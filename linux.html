		<h1>By the way, I use Arch!</h1>
		<p>Yeah that's the distro I use what are you gonna do about it? Did you go out of your way to get a distro without systemd? Eh. I don't really care about that. These systemd haters probably use i3 anyway (or Gnome eurh..). Yeah I use dwm (muh minimalism is not just a meme, it is a way of life!).
		<h2>Wait.. You're not a linux user??</h2>
		<p>Someone reading this page might be confused as to what Linux even is. They might only have heard of Ubuntu (basically if Windows and Mac mixed and had a disabled Baby that decided to go free software lol). If you are such a person, let me illustrate to you this important point. There are two types of computer users: people who use a real chad manly linux distro like Arch, Artix, Alpine or whatever (or even another unix operating system like OpenBSD or FreeBSD), and then there are people who are <strike>dumn slaves</strike> good consoomers that use Windows, Mac, or even Ubuntu because that's all they know because they're stupid and ignorant and easily manipulateble (or maybe I'm the autistic one who knows). Basically, a true elite linux user is someone who has taken the red pill and sees the world for what it is. He has real goals in life and also has a functionning human brain. The other person is a coomer consoomer degenerate commie brainwashed zombie sheep who simply does what the media and society says is normal because he's unable to think for himself and doesn't care about working more efficiently or learning anything of value (that is to say, he has taken the blue pill!).</p>
